Our group final project was created by four aspiring software devs with a vision of building an app that was both fun and educational. Play today at [UseitorLoseIt](http://csgibson4.com:8080/N-BackREST/#/) and try it out! 


Memory is one of the most essential cognitive functions in a personâ€™s life. We were passionate about building an app that tests short-term memory/brain fitness. One of the numerous inspirations for the game came from a University of Washington neuroscience project, which designed a short test for testing cognitive function and memory by having users memorized short arrays of alphabet letters in certain amount of time. 
We have 40 years of military experience combined, observing and strategizing innovative ways to improve cognitive health in short-term memory & prevent memory decay.

The end goal of the 4 memory games was to create a user-interactive, friendly experience that was easy to use, clear with instructions and bug-free.  We wanted to be able for users to compare how their memory is, using charts, to others or friends.  Some of the challenges/obstacles we faced were with issues uploading a database onto RDS, login & pathing issues, and Angular Charts documentation. Also, given more time, we would have liked to implement a way for others to challenge their friends dynamically, by clicking on their profile and challenging. Any feedback to any of us four is much appreciated!
